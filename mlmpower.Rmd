```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(rstan)
```

This is very much inspired by Andrew Marder's [powerstan](https://github.com/amarder/powerstan/).

## Generative Model

```{r model}
model.code <- "
parameters {
  real mu;
  real sigma;
}

model {}

generated quantities {
  real y;
  y <- normal_rng(mu, sigma);
}
"

model <- stan_model(model_code = model_code)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
