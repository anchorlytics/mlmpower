```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The following is very much inspired by Andrew Marder's [powerstan](https://github.com/amarder/powerstan/).
But adapted for multilevel model.

```{r libraries, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rstan)
```

## Generative Model

```{r model}
model.code <- "
parameters {
  real mu;
  real sigma;
}

model {}

generated quantities {
  real y;
  y <- normal_rng(mu, sigma);
}
"

model <- stan_model(model_code = model_code)
```
